* Detecting Numbers Written In Kannada Numerical System using a  ResNet-34, a **Deep Residual Learning Neural Network for Image Recognition.**

* The **DataSet** was in a pixel information **csv** file containing an image of **28x28 pixel**.

* First, I tried to train it using **RandomForest Classfier** which gave an accuracy score of **97.98 %.**

* Then I switched to **ResNet34.**

* I have achieved an accuracy of **99.4 %.**
